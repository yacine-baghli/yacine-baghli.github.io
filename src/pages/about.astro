					<p>
						I joined a "classe préparatoire universitaire aux grandes écoles" in mathematics, 
						physics and computer science at the Faculté des Sciences et Technologies of Nancy.

						Then, I progressed to the fourth year at Polytech Nancy, specializing in Intelligent and Autonomous Systems (SIA) 
						as part of the IA2R program in 2023. This specialization allowed me to deepen my knowledge in advanced AI and 
						robotics. As part of my studies, I spent four months in Montreal, Canada, attending the École de Technologie 
						Supérieure (ÉTS). During my time there, I took advanced courses in Computer Vision, focusing on image processing, 
						pattern recognition, and neural networks, with hands-on labs using MATLAB. I also studied signal processing and 
						delved into bio-mechanical engineering through courses like Rehabilitation Engineering, where we worked on data 
						acquisition and analysis at the CRCHUM in Montreal. Additionally, I explored Health Sector Risks: Sources and 
						Evaluation Techniques and learned Quantitative Methods in Systems Engineering. This course allowed me to tackle 
						complex operational management problems, both graphically and algebraically, and solve real-world business 
						challenges using Lingo.

						What characterizes me most is my ability to adapt to new environments and to learn new 
						things and new technologies.

					<p>
						I'm open-minded by nature, and place great importance on communication and knowledge sharing.
