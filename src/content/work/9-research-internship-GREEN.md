### Objective:
During my internship at the GREEN laboratory, I gained an in-depth understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind communication interfaces, as well as advanced prototyping and simulation techniques for developing embedded control systems. The knowledge and skills acquired during this period are essential for designing and testing reliable and high-performance systems across various application domains.

### Practical Work:
I engaged in hands-on work related to digital integration, which strengthened my programming skills in DSP/DSC using Code Composer Studio. I configured peripherals such as ADCs and PWM and implemented current regulation techniques. The experience I gained working with microcontrollers F28P65X, F28379D, and F28388D, as well as simulation tools like Simulink, was particularly enriching.

### Web Interface Development:
The development of a web interface for UDP communication through a router added a practical and modern dimension to my project, allowing me to better understand the challenges of network communication and user interface design. Despite facing technical challenges, particularly with the simultaneous integration of the Simulink simulation and the web page, these obstacles provided valuable learning opportunities.

### Research Environment Exposure:
Additionally, I was able to observe the inner workings of a research laboratory, witnessing collaborative work dynamics, project management processes, and the rigorous methodologies in place to ensure the quality and relevance of the results obtained. This immersion in the research environment offered me a unique perspective on innovation and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

### Acknowledgments:
I would like to extend my gratitude to the GREEN team and my supervisors for their support and guidance throughout this internship. This experience was pivotal in enhancing my technical and professional skills and has opened up exciting prospects for my future career in embedded control systems.
