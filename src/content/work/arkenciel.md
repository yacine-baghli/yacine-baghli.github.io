### The association "Arkenciel"
I joined the association "Arkenciel," which helps middle and high school students better understand their courses by connecting them with engineering students who assist them in comprehending and assimilating the material. I had the opportunity to join this association as part of a project to get involved in school life (PIVE). At the beginning of the year, I assisted middle school students with their homework and math classes. I continue to accompany and assist high school students, primarily in mathematics.
### The association's objective
One of the association's main objectives is to encourage these students to pursue their career aspirations and to continue their education after high school, aiming for higher studies. We aim to dispel any preconceived notions they may have about these fields of study by providing concrete answers to their questions. As engineering students, we are well-positioned to present these studies and share our personal experiences, encouraging them to consider pursuing higher education.
